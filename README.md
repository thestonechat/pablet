# pablet

Mobile app to turn your phone into a tablet.

Originally started for fun and to work with networks, but there wasn't much networking to do, so yes it's for OSU!.

## What it does

pablet is a simple app that lets you control your cursor from your phone. It does this by using your local Wi-Fi network to send touch data from your phone to the computer. It's simple. In total less than 5 hours of work has gone into this (so far).
